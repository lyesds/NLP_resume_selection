In the proposed system the DTMF decoder, PIR sensor, Ultrasonic sensor and the robot is interfaced with the PIC controller. The robot is navigated according to the commands given in the mobile. The DTMF decoder will decode the particular data and give it to the controller. According to the data the robot will move. The PIR sensor is used to check whether any human is present in the area. If any human detected then a message will be send to the monitoring GSM number. The ultrasonic sensor is used to stop colliding with obstacles. If any obstacle or human detected GPS value is fetch by controller and send through GSM MINI PROJECT DES IG N AND FABRIC ATION OF RED OBJEC T TRAC KING 2-AXIS ROBOT US ING MATLAB S OFTWAREDES IG N AND FABRIC ATION OF RED OBJEC T TRAC KING 2-AXIS ROBOT US ING MATLAB S OFTWAREObject tracking can be done by identifying and tracking some specific feature of the moving object such as color that belongs to the moving object. Thus trajectories of moving object can be traced through this process over time. Object tracking using computer vision is a crucial component in achieving robotic surveillance.The main aim of the object tracking is to track the object based on the information obtained from video sequences.In our project, we determine the region on interest (ROI) of the moving target which is followed adaptive color filter to extract the color information and thus the object is tracked. The main contribution on this paper is that the introduction on a color filtering method which is capable of adaptively identifying the most salient color feature that belongs to for moving object and using this color feature for tracking.
